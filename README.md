# Food-Ordering-Mobile-App-Design-

I have made Food Ordering Mobile Application Design in Figma  by using different plugins.
Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based, with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for macOS and Windows. The Figma mobile app for Android and iOS allow viewing and interacting with Figma prototypes in real-time mobile devices.
